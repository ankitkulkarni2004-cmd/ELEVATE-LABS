This To-Do List application is a simple console-based Python program that allows users to manage their daily tasks interactively through a menu-driven interface. The program continuously displays options such as adding
a new task, viewing all tasks, marking a task as completed, deleting a task, or exiting the application. Tasks are stored in a list as dictionaries, where each task contains a description and a completion status 
(True or False). When a user selects an option, the corresponding function is executed—for example, adding a task appends a new dictionary to the list, marking a task updates its completion status, and deleting a task 
removes it from the list. The program runs inside a loop so the user can perform multiple operations until they choose to exit
